# Samuel Glickman
Welcome to my website! My name is Sam, and I am a first year Ph.D. student studying mathematics at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. This website will serve as a hub for my research, teaching, projects, and hobbies. I will update the site as I create content and aim to provide valuable insights that will aid and inspire others.
